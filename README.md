# Static Node.js and Express Site
In this project I have created a portfolio site to showcase the great projects I've built. The site will contain a modern landing page, an about page where I have shared contact info, practiced my elevator pitch, talked a little about myself, and a series of project pages to show off and detail at least my first five projects from this Techdegree.
